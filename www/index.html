<h1>Rules of the game</h1>
<p>The present application is a hangman game where players try to guess one of randomly selected English proverbs. The letters and spaces that the proverb consists of are visible aboce the pictures.
The progress of the game is reflected by pictures showing an unpleasant situation being replaced every time that a letter that does not appear in the proverb is clicked on the keyboard below.
When one of the letters that the frase consists of is clicked, all the spots where it appears are displayed at once. If you hit a wrong letter 9 times, the games will end and you will witness an unpleasant scene on the picture board :P The results are measured by the number of wrong letters clicked before guessing the proverb. Enjoy ! 
    </p>

            <h3>Khal Drogo <img src="img/p04.jpg" alt="obr" /></h3><p>Drogo is a khal or warlord of the Dothraki, the famed nomadic horse-lords of the eastern continent beyond the Narrow Sea. The Dothraki are fierce warriors, skilled in battle, unrelenting in combat and known for savagery towards non-Dothraki. Drogo was very young to have his own khalasar, particularly such a large one. He is a legendary warrior and has never been defeated in battle.</p>

            <h3>Renly Baratheon <img src="img/p03.jpg" alt="obr" /></h3><p>Renly is the third and youngest son of Steffon and Cassana Baratheon. Renly has two older brothers Robert and Stannis. Their parents died when the boys were young and Robert inherited his father's titles. Robert led a rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, deposing and replacing him as the King on the Iron Throne. He made Renly the Lord of Storm's End following his victory. Renly was only a child during the civil war, so he did not fight.</p>

            <h3>Joffrey Baratheon  <img src="img/p02.jpg" alt="obr" /></h3><p>
            
            Joffrey is believed to be the oldest son and heir of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, both of whom entered into a political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. In reality, his father is Jaime Lannister, the queen's brother and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Their sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins. Joffrey is spoiled, arrogant, cowardly, and sadistic; however these traits are further exacerbated upon Robert's death and his ascension to the crown.

            <h3>Daenerys Targaryen <img src="img/p05.jpg" alt="obr" /></h3><p>Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King", and his sister-wife, Rhaella. Her father died during the Sack of King's Landing, before she was even born. On the night Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, a vast storm raged. For this reason, she is sometimes called "Daenerys Stormborn". As a baby, she was taken into exile in the Free Cities with her brother, Viserys, by loyal retainers, among them Ser Willem Darry</p>

His mother died in childbirth, while the forces of Robert Baratheon closed in on the island. Before they could arrive, Viserys and his baby sister Daenerys were smuggled to safety in the Free Cities, across the Narrow Sea on the continent of Essos. Bereft of followers, Viserys spent the next 17 years traveling between the Free Cities trying to find new supporters for an attempt to retake the Iron Throne. </p>

            <h3>Kraznys mo Nakloz <img src="img/p01.jpg" alt="obr" /></h3><p>Kraznys mo Nakloz is one of the Good Masters, the ruling elite of the city of Astapor, composed of slave traders. As with many of his compatriots, Kraznys only speaks a Low Valyrian dialect and does not know the Common Tongue of Westeros. Thus when dealing with foreign customers, Kraznys relies on his slave Missandei to serve as his translator.</p>
